# conclusion
/being on time/eat tea or coffie & food useful for learning/ cold environment reduces learning/ walking before coming to the company make you tired/ microbe are everywhere and you feel sick/using phone & social media while learning disturb your concentration/ if your mind is on a topic and you are stressed share it whith the person or your boss/ if the company internet does not working use personal interner so that your time is not wasted/clean your personal desk/personally i didnt learn well in project whith vahid salehi so i went to toutube and looked at the project of milad bahrami/
